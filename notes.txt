DISCOS:
- super() calls the constructor of a class' superclass
- using char as a parameter gives an error because it is a reserved keyword.
- you can pass the current object into an inherited method as a parameter using "this" keyword.

QCC:
- What is the most efficient way to handle all 3 classes in our driver file?
- Is it possible to play all 3 characters at once?
- How are we able to call methods in both a class and its superclass?
